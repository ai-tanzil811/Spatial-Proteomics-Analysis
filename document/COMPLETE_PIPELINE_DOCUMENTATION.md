## 1. Overview — What Was Done <a name="1-overview"></a>

**Goal**: Convert single-cell protein expression data (MIBI-SoC, 40 antibody markers) into a gene-expression-like dataset where columns are HUGO gene symbols instead of protein/antibody names.

**What was produced**: A new CSV dataset (`gene_expression_dataset.csv`) containing:
- ~570,000 rows (one per cell)
- 40 gene-symbol columns (expression values, arcsinh-normalized)
- Cell annotations: cell type, sample ID, spatial coordinates
- Clinical metadata: patient ID, HPV status, survival, recurrence

**Why**: To enable analysis with standard scRNA-seq computational tools (Scanpy, Seurat) and biological interpretation via gene symbols (DEG, gene set scoring, CellChat).

## 3. Protein-to-Gene Mapping (UniProt) <a name="3-mapping"></a>

### 3.1 Mapping Method

Each of the 40 MIBI antibody markers was mapped to its corresponding HUGO gene symbol using **UniProt Swiss-Prot** (reviewed human entries only). The mapping was verified by querying:

```
https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=gene:{GENE}+AND+organism_id:9606+AND+reviewed:true
```

Each mapping records:
- **MIBI marker name** (as in the original data)
- **HUGO gene symbol** (primary gene name from UniProt)
- **UniProt accession** (Swiss-Prot ID)
- **UniProt protein name** (full name from database)

### 3.3 Special Cases

#### PTPRC Isoforms (CD45 / CD45RA / CD45RO)
All three antibodies detect the **same gene** (*PTPRC*, P08575) but different splice variants:
- **CD45** (total) → column `PTPRC`
- **CD45RA** (naive T cells, exon A present) → column `PTPRC_RA`
- **CD45RO** (memory T cells, all variable exons spliced out) → column `PTPRC_RO`

**Decision**: Keep all three as separate columns with suffixes. Collapsing would lose the naive/memory T cell distinction, which is biologically important. For gene-set overlap, only `PTPRC` (total) is used.

#### PanCK (Pan-Cytokeratin)
The PanCK antibody cocktail detects multiple keratins (KRT5, KRT8, KRT14, KRT18, KRT19). It is impossible to determine which specific keratin is contributing signal.

**Decision**: Mapped to **KRT18** (P05783) as the most commonly referenced representative. Flagged as `is_ambiguous=True` in the mapping table.

#### HLA-DR
The HLA-DR antibody detects a heterodimer (HLA-DRA + HLA-DRB1). 

**Decision**: Mapped to **HLA-DRA** (P01903, alpha chain) as the primary chain. Flagged as ambiguous.

#### CD8
CD8 is a heterodimer (CD8A + CD8B).

**Decision**: Mapped to **CD8A** (P01732, alpha chain) as the more commonly referenced subunit.

## 4. Pipeline Steps in Detail <a name="4-pipeline-steps"></a>

<!-- ### Step 0: Export UniProt mapping
- Saves `uniprot_protein_to_gene_mapping.csv` — the full provenance table
- This file documents exactly how each protein was mapped and to which UniProt entry -->

### Step 1: Load data
- Reads the arcsinh-normalized expression matrix (~570K cells × 43 columns)
- Reads spatial coordinates (~570K cells with X, Y positions)
- Reads clinical metadata (378 samples with survival, HPV status, etc.)

### Step 2: Separate expression from annotations
- Identifies which columns are protein markers (40 markers)
- Which columns are metadata (sample_id, cell_id, cluster, cluster_label)
- Renames protein columns → gene symbols using the UniProt mapping

### Step 3: Handle PTPRC isoforms
- CD45 → `PTPRC`, CD45RA → `PTPRC_RA`, CD45RO → `PTPRC_RO`
- All linked to same UniProt entry P08575 but kept as separate features

### Step 4: Build AnnData object
- Expression matrix as `adata.X`
- Gene metadata in `adata.var` (protein name, gene symbol, UniProt ID, ambiguity flags)
- Cell annotations in `adata.obs` (sample, cell type, cluster)
- Raw arcsinh values stored in `adata.layers["arcsinh_norm"]`

### Step 5: Add spatial coordinates
- Matches cells between expression and spatial files by `sample_id + cell_id` key
- Stored in `adata.obsm["spatial"]`

### Step 6: Merge clinical metadata
- Maps sample-level clinical data to each cell
- Columns: patient_id, tissue_type, primarysite, hpvstatus_new, survival_status, survival_day, recurred

### Step 7: Technology-specific preprocessing
- **No renormalization** — data is already arcsinh-transformed (see Section 7)
- **99.9th percentile clipping** per gene — removes MIBI hot-pixel artifacts
- **Min-max scaling** layer [0,1] for comparisons
- **Z-score** layer for heatmaps and gene-set scoring

### Step 8: Scanpy embedding
- PCA (up to 30 components on all 40 gene features)
- UMAP (2D, 30 neighbors)
- Leiden clustering (resolution 0.8)

### Step 9: Save outputs
- Primary: `gene_expression_dataset.csv` (new gene-expression dataset with metadata)
- AnnData: `mibi_as_gene_expression.h5ad`
- Cell metadata: `cell_metadata.csv` (includes UMAP coordinates)
- Pure expression: `gene_expression_matrix.csv` (genes only, no metadata)

### How to use the new dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("output/gene_expression_dataset.csv", index_col="cell_barcode")

# Gene expression columns only
gene_cols = df.columns[df.columns.get_loc("PECAM1"):]  # everything after metadata
expr = df[gene_cols]

# Get expression for T cells only
t_cells = df[df["cell_type"].isin(["CD4 T cell", "CD8 T cell"])]
```

## 6. Technology-Specific Issues (MIBI) <a name="6-mibi-issues"></a>

### 6.1 Signal Spillover (Ion Beam Crosstalk)
MIBI uses metal-conjugated antibodies measured by mass spectrometry. Adjacent mass channels can bleed signal into each other.
- **Impact**: Low-level false positives for markers on adjacent channels
- **Mitigation**: Authors applied QC; we additionally clip at 99.9th percentile per gene

### 6.2 Segmentation Artifacts
Cell segmentation in tissue images is imperfect. In dense regions, signal from neighboring cells can leak across boundaries.
- **Impact**: Mixed cell-type signals; a tumor cell may show low-level immune markers
- **Mitigation**: The kNN cell classification with probability scores partially addresses this. Low-confidence cells (kNN.prob < 0.5) can be filtered if desired.

### 6.3 No Dropout / Zero Inflation
Unlike scRNA-seq, MIBI measures protein in every cell. There is **no dropout** or zero-inflation.
- **Impact**: ~0% zeros in the data (vs ~90% in scRNA-seq). Tools that model zero-inflation (ZINB, MAST, DCA) are **inappropriate** for this data.
- **Mitigation**: Use Wilcoxon rank-sum or t-tests for DEG. Do not apply scRNA-seq imputation methods (MAGIC, scVI denoising, etc.).

### 6.4 Batch Effects
7 patients, 378 regions — patient-level and slide-level batch effects exist.
- **Impact**: Technical variation may confound biological comparisons across patients
- **Mitigation**: If comparing across patients, consider Harmony, scVI, or ComBat batch correction

### 6.5 Panel Size Limitation
Only 40 proteins measured (vs ~20,000 genes in scRNA-seq).
- **Impact**: Cannot perform genome-wide analyses, pathway enrichment has very low coverage
- **Mitigation**: Use custom gene sets from the panel; do not attempt GO/KEGG enrichment

---

## 7. Transformation & Normalization Decisions <a name="7-normalization"></a>

### Why NO Further Normalization Was Applied

The input data (`labeled_arcsinh_norm_data.csv`) is already **arcsinh-normalized** by the original authors. This is the standard normalization for mass-spectrometry-based proteomics data:

```
arcsinh(x / cofactor)   where cofactor = 5 (typical for MIBI/CyTOF)
```

**Arcsinh is the protein-data equivalent of log1p for RNA-seq:**
- Both are variance-stabilizing transforms
- Both compress high values while preserving low-value resolution
- Both produce roughly log-normal–like distributions
- Scanpy/Seurat treat them identically for PCA, clustering, DEG

**What would go WRONG if we re-normalized:**
- `sc.pp.normalize_total()` → designed for count data; protein data doesn't have library-size variation the same way
- `sc.pp.log1p()` → double-transform (arcsinh already applied); would over-compress
- `scran` normalization → assumes dropout/UMI counts; would introduce artifacts

### Additional layers provided
| Layer | Transform | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `arcsinh_norm` | Raw arcsinh values (untouched) | Ground truth, DEG, most analyses |
| `scaled_0_1` | Min-max to [0,1] per gene | Cross-gene comparisons, heatmaps |
| `zscore` | Z-score per gene | Gene-set scoring, standardized comparisons |

### Why NO Imputation Was Applied

MIBI data has near-zero sparsity. Imputation methods (MAGIC, scVI, SAVER) were designed to recover dropout in sparse scRNA-seq data. Applying them to MIBI data would:
- Smooth away real biological variation between cells
- Introduce artificial correlations between genes
- Violate the methods' statistical assumptions (they assume dropout noise)

## 8. Assumptions & Limitations <a name="8-assumptions"></a>

### What This Conversion CAN Do
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Differential expression (DEG) | ✅ Works | Wilcoxon on arcsinh values |
| Cell clustering & embedding | ✅ Works | PCA + UMAP + Leiden |
| Gene set scoring (custom sets) | ✅ Works | 8 curated gene sets from panel |
| Cell-cell communication (CellChat) | ⚠️ Limited | Only LR pairs within 40 genes |
| Spatial gene expression analyses | ✅ Works | Coordinates preserved |
| Survival modeling | ✅ Works | Clinical metadata attached |

### What This Conversion CANNOT Do
| Limitation | Reason |
|---|---|
| Genome-wide GSEA (GO/KEGG/Reactome) | Only 40 genes — far too few for ranked enrichment |
| Trajectory / RNA velocity | No spliced/unspliced information |
| Gene regulatory network inference | 40 genes cannot capture TF-target relationships |
| Imputation of unmeasured genes | No principled way to predict ~20,000 genes from 40 |
| Direct quantitative RNA-protein comparison | Different scales, different noise models |

### Key Assumptions

1. **Protein → gene is 1:1** — Mostly true for CD markers. Exceptions flagged (PanCK, HLA-DR, PTPRC isoforms).

2. **Protein abundance reflects gene activity** — The correlation between protein and mRNA is ~0.4–0.6 across published studies. Post-translational regulation, protein half-life, and secretion can decouple them. Results reflect **protein-level biology**, not transcription.

3. **arcsinh ≈ log1p for computational tools** — Both are variance-stabilizing transforms. Scanpy, Seurat, and most DE methods treat them identically. This is mathematically sound.

4. **40 genes are sufficient for the intended analyses** — For DEG between cell types and custom gene-set scoring, yes. For genome-wide analyses, no.

---

## 9. Validation Checks <a name="9-validation"></a>

Script `02_validation_checks.py` runs 6 automated checks:

### Check 1: Per-gene distribution shape
- Histograms for all 40 genes
- Protein data should show unimodal or bimodal distributions (NOT uniform)
- arcsinh-transformed values should resemble log-normal (similar to log1p RNA)

### Check 2: Marker–cell type concordance
- For known marker–cell type pairs (e.g., CD3E should be high in T cells), tests whether:
  - Mean expression is higher in expected cell types (fold change > 1.2)
  - Difference is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney p < 0.01)
- Expected results: CD3E high in T cells, MS4A1 high in B cells, CD68 high in macrophages, etc.

### Check 3: Gene-gene correlation structure
- Correlation matrix of all 40 genes
- Expected positive correlations: CD3E-CD4, CD3E-CD8A (T cell co-expression)
- Expected low/negative correlations: CD3E-KRT18 (immune vs tumor)

### Check 4: UMAP visualization
- Cell types should form visually distinct clusters
- Key markers should show expected spatial patterns on UMAP

### Check 5: DEG per cell type
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test: each cell type vs all others
- Top markers for each cell type should match known biology

### Check 6: Dynamic range
- Summary statistics per gene (mean, std, min, max, % zeros)
- Expected: continuous values in [0, ~3], NOT binary, near-zero sparsity

---

## 10. Downstream Analyses <a name="10-downstream"></a>

### 10.1 DEG & Gene Set Scoring (`03_deg_and_enrichment.py`)
- DEGs per cell type (Wilcoxon, all 40 genes)
- DEGs for HPV+ vs HPV- in tumor cells
- DEGs for recurred vs non-recurred
- 8 custom gene sets scored per cell:
  - T cell activation, Immune checkpoint, Antigen presentation, Tumor markers
  - Immune infiltration, Regulatory T cell, Cytotoxicity, Stromal

### 10.2 CellChat (`04_cellchat_analysis.R`)
- Cell-cell communication inference using CellChatDB.human
- Limited to LR pairs where both ligand and receptor are among the 40 genes
- Outputs: interaction network, heatmap, signaling roles, LR pair table
